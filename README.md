## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most difficult aspect of the project was using the overlay image to fit the main image of the card. The second step was to adjust the icon in the center of the overlay image.

### Continued development

It would be helpful for me to try the overlay image in future projects in order to get more comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

The example provided on w3schools.com helped me to grasp the concept of how to solve this challenge(https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp).
